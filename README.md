## Add PARA properties

This plugin gives you 3 new slashes commands:

- Project [file page under a project]
- Area [file page under an area]
- Resource [file page under a resource]

Each will create a new property (`project::`, `area::` or `resource::`) into the current page.

This is my workflow. I use those properties to query for pages related to projects, areas and resources.
